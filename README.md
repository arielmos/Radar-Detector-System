# Radar-Detector-System
 Radar Detector System - Digital Computer Structure - Final Project
 
 •	Design and implementation of an MCU-based radar system for monitoring and detecting objects in space using an ultrasonic odometer and Servo motor.
 
			The space scan performs in a 180-degree section using Servo motor movement, the measuring range using the odometer ranges from 2M-4.5M.
   
			The angular motion control of a servo motor is PWM based.
   
 •	As part of the project, a code in the C ++ / C language developed for the implementation of a real-time system based on interrupts (MCU side) for components activation and data
 
			reading from the odometer.
 
 •	For display and user interface, a PC is being used on which the radar image displayed.
 
			The MCU connected to the PC using asynchronous serial communication (UART) in RS-232 standard.
   
 •	The user interface on the PC side is a Python based and allow setting parameters, sending files and high-level commands to the MCU and display radar image on PC. 
 
 •	The interface allow the transfer of files that include high-level coded commands for implementation on the controller side.
 
			The files in the controller is being stored in FLASH memory.
